<p>Creativity has always been at the forefront of my life. I enjoy the process behind it and the problem-solving abilities it provokes. I am good at finding creative solutions to problems and then implementing them in a practical way. These skills have been fostered by years of property management – dealing with both practical (e.g. Why does that field always flood and what can we do about it?) and more abstract issues (disputes between neighbours) – and by 3 years spent studying Sculpture.  Creative solutions are useless without practical applications. Through my years of study and work I have developed the ability to forecast problems before they might arise. This gives me the opportunity to identify solutions before the problems become apparent. This ability to stay a step ahead, means that issues can be very quickly dealt with in an organised manner that benefits all involved as much as possible. I am interested in the way that technology is permeating the art world, and the exciting possibilities surrounding that. Virtual reality, augmented reality, 3d design and printing all open the doors to fantastic possibilities in the industry and it is something I would like to be involved with.  The idea of being able to combine both the practical and the creative sides of myself excites me, as it allows me to fulfil both the practical and creative sides of my personality.</p>
